# MOGA on STM32F429 – Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Embedded Optimization

This project implements a **Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA)** on the **STM32F429** microcontroller, aiming to perform real-time evolutionary optimization for resource-constrained embedded systems.

> ✅ Tested and deployed on: STM32F429I-Discovery board  
> 📡 Communication via UART to PC for result visualization  
> 📈 Supports benchmark functions: Schaffer, Fonseca, Kursawe, ZDT3, etc.
